# Community Worldbuilding Repository

### What is this?
A worldbuilding exercise using git for collaboration and version control.

### How does this work?
Anyone can contribute text, images, etc (probably not video, too large) to the repository.
Contributing is done by opening a pull request, issues can be used to track work items or as discussion topics.
You have to get a pull request approved by one other member before merging, that way there is constant feedback on the worldbuilding.

### What are the rules?
- No nsfw image or excessively nsfw text contributions.
- No merging contributions into master without at least 1 pull request approval.
- Major decisions should be handled via an open issue.
- Keep contributions organized, follow established formats

### How to contribute
1. If you've never used git before you should probably learn it first and set up git if you haven't.
2. `git clone` this repo. Enter the directory and `git checkout -b [your branch name]` (no []). 
3. Make your contribution, `git add [file1] [file2] ...` the new files, `git commit -m "describe your changes here"`, and `git push origin [your branch name]`.
4. Repeat above steps until you're done your contribution, then go to github, select your branch from the dropdown on the code browser page, and then press the create new pull request button.
5. Title (and label) the pull request appropriately, add a reviewer if you want, and a description.
6. After at least one person has accepted the request, you can squash and merge into master
