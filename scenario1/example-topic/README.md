# Example Topic
#### This is an example of what a topic should look like, so we keep the repo clean.

- Every topic folder should have a readme, any other folder that may have hard to navigate content should consider including a readme.
- I'd imagine most topic folders will have something like a wiki folder to include general information about said topic.
- Wiki files should be .md files like this one, wikis should include a README.md.
- A topic can have subtopics, subtopics can have subtopics.
