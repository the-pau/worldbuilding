To use these templates, simply change the commands at the top, that should do the trick for the format you chose. Requires little Tex knowledge, you will need both a latex editor and inkscape tho. (Inkscape handles the logo, maybe there are tex editors that dont need it, but i use texmaker, which does require it, but at least i know it works)

You will also need to compile the document twice, for technical reasons that arent important, the total page count will say 0 instead of whatever the actual number of pages is on the first go. 

Make sure you compile with LuaLaTex and you have the [Code39/3 of 9 font](https://www.dafont.com/3of9-barcode.font) installed
